## todo

* make nav light gray so it doesn't look weird on mobile. and use a book for brand for now
* make home page slightly smaller on mobile so the text doesn't wrap
* use a short title on the posts page so it doesn't look so weird
* lessen the padding on mobile so it doesn't look so weird
* add newsletter page
* pages
    * make separate layout for page vs post

## eventually

* move site specific things into main repo, then reference config values in the theme files
