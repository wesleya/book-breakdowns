## What kind of books will I find here?

I enjoy reading about career development, productivity, software development and personal finance. You can see my most recent posts <a href="/post">here</a>.

## How often do you post?

Honestly I have no Idea, sorry! Sometimes I go through a book every couple weeks. Other times it's every couple months. You can <a>subscribe</a> to updates if you want though.

##  Who is this for?

I started taking notes when I realized I couldn't recall details of my favorite books without re-reading them every so often. I thought It'd be a cool personal project to formalize these notes for others to reference as well.

##  Are you making money off of me?

All notes on this site includes an amazon referral link to the book I took the notes on. I get a referral commission if you purchase anything through that link.
  This will hopefully be enough to prevent any need to add any slow loading text or video Ads to this site!
